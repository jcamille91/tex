@article{qubit_radiation,
	Abstract = {Technologies that rely on quantum bits (qubits) require long coherence times and high-fidelity operations1. Superconducting qubits are one of the leading platforms for achieving these objectives2,3. However, the coherence of superconducting qubits is affected by the breaking of Cooper pairs of electrons4--6. The experimentally observed density of the broken Cooper pairs, referred to as quasiparticles, is orders of magnitude higher than the value predicted at equilibrium by the Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer theory of superconductivity7--9. Previous work10--12 has shown that infrared photons considerably increase the quasiparticle density, yet even in the best-isolated systems, it remains much higher10 than expected, suggesting that another generation mechanism exists13. Here we provide evidence that ionizing radiation from environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays contributes to this observed difference. The effect of ionizing radiation leads to an elevated quasiparticle density, which we predict would ultimately limit the coherence times of superconducting qubits of the type measured here to milliseconds. We further demonstrate that radiation shielding reduces the flux of ionizing radiation and thereby increases the energy-relaxation time. Albeit a small effect for today's qubits, reducing or mitigating the impact of ionizing radiation will be critical for realizing fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers.},

abstract={The scalable application of quantum information science will stand on reproducible and controllable high-coherence quantum bits (qubits). Here, we revisit the design and fabrication of the superconducting flux qubit, achieving a planar device with broad-frequency tunability, strong anharmonicity, high reproducibility and relaxation times in excess of 40{\thinspace}$\mu$s at its flux-insensitive point. Qubit relaxation times T1 across 22 qubits are consistently matched with a single model involving resonator loss, ohmic charge noise and 1/f-flux noise, a noise source previously considered primarily in the context of dephasing. We furthermore demonstrate that qubit dephasing at the flux-insensitive point is dominated by residual thermal-photons in the readout resonator. The resulting photon shot noise is mitigated using a dynamical decoupling protocol, resulting in T2?85{\thinspace}$\mu$s, approximately the 2T1 limit. In addition to realizing an improved flux qubit, our results uniquely identify photon shot noise as limiting T2 in contemporary qubits based on transverse qubit--resonator interaction.},

It is shown that the familiar ?macroscopic quantum phenomena? such as flux quantization and the Josephson effect are irrelevant in this context, because they correspond to states having a very small value of a certain critical property (christened ?disconnectivity?) while the states important for a discussion of the quantum theory of measurement have a very high value of this property. Various possibilities for verifying experimentally the existence of such states are discussed, with the conclusion that the most promising is probably the observation of quantum tunnelling between states with macroscopically different properties. It is shown that because of their very high ?quantum purity? and consequent very low dissipation at low temperatures, superconducting systems (in particular SQUID rings) offer good prospects for such an observation.}",

abstract={We report here the effect of film qualities in superconductors on the properties of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). The sensitivity of MKIDs between crystal aluminum films and amorphous aluminum films is compared. The good quality and crystallized aluminum films have been prepared by using molecular beam epitaxy. We have confirmed that epitaxial Al(111) films were grown on Si(111) substrates with X-ray diffraction and in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction measurements. The amorphous aluminum films on the Si(111) wafers have been deposited by electron beam evaporation. We have measured transmission losses of MKIDs, noise spectrum and relaxation time against optical pulses, changing MKIDs' bath temperature from 0.11 K to 0.55 K in a dilution refrigerator. Despite of the improvement in normal resistivity, the quasiparticle decay time of both films are equivalent and 450 $\mu$s at 0.11 K. The electrical noise equivalent power of the both MKIDs are also comparable and around {\$}10^{\{}-17{\}}{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}mbox{\{}W{\}}/{\backslash}sqrt{\{}{\backslash}mbox{\{}Hz{\}}{\}}{\$}. Fabrication details and performance data of both films are presented.},

The superposition of the two states carrying opposite macroscopic persistent currents is manipulated by resonant microwave pulses. Readout by means of switching-event measurement with an attached superconducting quantum interference device revealed quantum-state oscillations with high fidelity. Under strong microwave driving, it was possible to induce hundreds of coherent oscillations. Pulsed operations on this first sample yielded a relaxation time of 900 nanoseconds and a free-induction dephasing time of 20 nanoseconds. These results are promising for future solid-state quantum computing.},

abstract={The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},
